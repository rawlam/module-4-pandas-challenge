## Written report

Based on the schools and students complete data, district schools and their students have a higher budget than the charter schools and their students. In terms of student populations, all district schools have a large 2000 to 5000 student body while their counter parts range from less than 1000 to 2000 students. 

When looking at class scores and passing grades, charter school students have a more even balance between math and reading scores of 83 and 84 respectively, while district schools tend to have lower math scores compared to their reading scores, 77 and 81.

The percentage of district school students passing math and reading are 67% and 81% respectively, meanwhile 93% of charter school students pass math and 97% pass reading.

Medium to small student populations achieve higher scores in math and reading and have a higher percentage of passing students across the same subjects.

Smaller student populations and/or class sizes aid in increasing math and reading scores, thus improving passing grades and averages. 

We can conclude from looking at this data, district schools can benefit from revising their class size and budget strategies based on the success of charter schools achieving higher passing scores with less spending per student in a smaller student body setting.
